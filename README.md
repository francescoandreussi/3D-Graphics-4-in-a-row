Hi, this is my thesis project for the bachelor degree in Computer Science!
If you want to try this videogame just open the file "project.html" on a browser and start playing!
Look at this page https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#Manual/Getting_Started/How_to_run_things_locally if you have troubles and you cannot visualize correctly the environment. I made a preview/demo video that I called "demo.webm".
You can read also my complete thesis (in Italian) in order to know whole the work I've done and the slides that I presented during the thesis discussion (in Italian and soon in English too).
I hope you like this little game and I look forward to have your suggestions and help in order to develop and improve this project!
Thanks!
